The yellow gold is a true yellow with no rosy tones, and the sterling silver is well...silver... The raised settings have flat stones in them so that you can't catch the stones on anything accidentally. The faceting in the stones is also very dynamic and looks ~luxe~ Really gorgeous rings in beautiful packaging with fast shipping. Great customer service too! When I had a sizing issue with my order, the seller was very quick to respond and help me out.

I had my son's name Tristen, and daughters name Baylie on the ring. Baylie turned out beautiful, but I can not read Tristens name. At first I thought it said Fisten, then Tisten, or also Tnstrn. It's very hard to make out the letters. It may be that I chose the wrong style of lettering, but I went with the recommended style. I will still wear it, cause I don't want to waste it, I just wish it was a little more legible. I still recommend this ring, just choose your letting wisely", score: 3, user_id: 7, listing_id: 4},

I mentioned in passing our astrological elements - but that I didn‚Äôt care as much about that as just the one silver circle. I was so excited to get it - I had sort of forgotten about the symbols. I put it on and was stoked. Loved it. Then I took a second look. And our tiny symbols are there... I cried.
